#You can do the same thing in a different way
# You can do calculations in Python as well!

# In order to do calculations, you can use the following operators:
# + for addition
# - for subtraction
# * for multiplication
# / for division

# In order to do calculations, you will need a variable first
# Variables are used to store data in a program
# You can create a variable like this:

age = 20

# You can then use the variable in a calculation
# You can also use the variable in a print statement
print("I am " + age + " years old.")

# You can also set the value of a variable to the result of a calculation
# Here is an example

money = 10 + 10

# Money equals 20
print(money)
print("I have " + money + " dollars.")

# You can also use variables in conditional statements
# Here is an example


if money = 20:
    print("I have less than 20 dollars.")
if money > 20:
    print("I have more than 20 dollars.")
else:
    print("I have less than 20 dollars.")
