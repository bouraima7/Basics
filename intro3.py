#In programming you can use conditions to make decisions in your program.
#There are two types of conditional statements in Python: if statements and else statements.
#Here is an example of an if statement:
if 5 > 2:
    print("5 is greater than 2")
# Here is an example of an else statement:
 if 2 > 5:
    print("2 is greater than 5")
else:
     print("2 is not greater than 5")
# You can also use an elif statement to check for multiple conditions.
# Here is an example:
 if 2 > 5:
     print("2 is greater than 5")
elif 2 == 5:
     print("2 is equal to 5")
else:
     print("2 is less than 5")
