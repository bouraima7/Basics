# You can use the following operators to compare values:
# == for equal to
# != for not equal to
# > for greater than
# < for less than
# >= for greater than or equal to
# <= for less than or equal to
# You can use these operators in conditional statements.
# Here is an example:

person1 = Aaron
person2 = Bob

age1 = 20
age2 = 25

if age1 > age2:
    print(person1 + " is older than " + person2)
elif age1 == age2:
    print(person1 + " is the same age as " + person2)
else:
    print(person1 + " is younger than " + person2)

# In this example, the program compares the ages of two people and prints out a message based on the comparison.
# The program compares the ages of two people and prints out a message based on the comparison.
